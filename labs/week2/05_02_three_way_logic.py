# 1) Initialize variable a to true, b to false and c to true


# 2) If you print(a and b or c) what it will return? Why?
# Does the order of operations matter?


# 3) Is print(a or b and c) different?


# 4)Assign c to false and print the value of a and b or c


# Understand the difference in each scenario
# What is happening here?


# 5) Now try to use some ()'s to force python to evaluate it differently.
